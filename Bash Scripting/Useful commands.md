getopt; getopts - used to parse command options and arguements (getopts is defined by POSIX (be sure that it runs on any system running bash in POSIX mode (e.g., set -o posix)), but does not support long options - getopt supports long, but is system specific) (https://www.computerhope.com/unix/bash/getopts.htm)
